ARIS: Echoes is a demo game that showcases the use of AI-powered NPCs in a story-driven experience. Discover a lost planet with your robot companion ARIS and work together to escape back to earth. It showcases a custom built NPC framework for Unreal Engine built with C++ and Machine Learning. It enables natural dialogue and an NPC that is controlled by an AI model, which in turn can dynamically perceive game events and perform actions in-game. This early version uses vector embeddings for context and heavy string manipulation to enable communication between the model and the engine. The goal is to convert this into a simple cpp port that can run locally and easily be embedded into other games without a large performance overhead.
